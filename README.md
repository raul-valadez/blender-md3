# .MD3 support for Blender

Updated version of [blender-md3](https://github.com/neumond/blender-md3) addon for working with Quake 3 model format (md3).
Now works with Blender â‰¥ 4.2.2

Can work with animations in any form (no need to bake to Shape Keys), textures and md3 tags (added as Empty objects).

Used [this](http://www.icculus.org/homepages/phaethon/q3a/formats/md3format.html) format reference.
