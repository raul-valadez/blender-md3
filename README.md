# .MD3 support for Blender

Updated version of [blender-md3](https://github.com/neumond/blender-md3) addon for working with Quake 3 model format (md3).
Now works with Blender â‰¥ 4.2.2

Can work with animations in any form (no need to bake to Shape Keys), textures and md3 tags (added as Empty objects).

Used [this](http://www.icculus.org/homepages/phaethon/q3a/formats/md3format.html) format reference.

## Supported versions

4.1 and up. This addon will probably not work with versions before 4.0 
API changed in how vertex normals are calculated. This broke backwards compatibility...
If I'm wrong let me know, maybe we can fix it!
